# ClassQR: An Attendance Verifier to Replace Traditional Attendance Check

Produces QR code per class that will be a requirement for the students to scan in order to verify their class attendance. It also creates a monthly report of your attendance in each class. This makes it easier for the students and as well as the facilitator of the class instead of having roll calls each class. They could just scan the QR code before or after the class.

Verifying studentsâ€™ attendance through QR codes are much easier and flexible in the current situation of the limited face to face classes. This alleviates the contact between the students rather than the traditional checking of attendance through pen and paper that roams around the classroom. Aside from this, it also helps instructors in a way that it lessens the time consumed for the attendance every class and manages their time wisely in teaching the lectures. With the technology in the modern age, this system can help faculty and staff to easily monitor and record the attendance of their students every class.
