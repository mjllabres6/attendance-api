# ClassQR: An Attendance Verifier to Replace Traditional Attendance Check

## Introduction

## Problem Statement
Professors may encounter productivity issues with their classes due to several reasons. One being the most important, time management and efficiency. The common dilemma is whether to move forward with a lecture or elaborate more on the current one. These types of scenarios are what separates remarkable teaching from the rest. Time management in conducting classes is considered hard due to the limited time given with so much to cover. This implies every chunk of time given is extremely important in classes. A significant task being held every class meeting is the attendance roll calls. The minutes covered by the traditional attendance check is considered vital minutes to class meetings. Having said that, this is a task that can be minimized with an innovative and automated solution. 


## Significance
To the students, they will benefit with the higher amount of time allocated for teaching. This time efficiency is thanks to the solution of having innovative app that would handle the attendance work among the student-professor relation.

To the professors, it will be beneficial to them due to the fact that they can allocate more time into their teaching and less time in having these attendance checks which could have been translated into more interactions with the class. With this modern solution, it also gives them the benefit of not doing the sheet work of recording the attendance, given the app has the feature to export attendance CSVs.

## Expected Output

An application that caters an attendance verifier tool that will greatly help the face to face classes. The app produces QR code per class that will be a requirement for the students to scan in order to verify their class attendance. It also creates a monthly report of your attendance in each class. This makes it easier for the students and as well as the facilitator of the class instead of having roll calls each class. They could just scan the QR code before or after the class.

Verifying students’ attendance through QR codes are much easier and flexible in the current situation of the limited face to face classes. This alleviates the contact between the students rather than the traditional checking of attendance through pen and paper that roams around the classroom. Aside from this, it also helps instructors in a way that it lessens the time consumed for the attendance every class and manages their time wisely in teaching the lectures. With the technology in the modern age, this system can help faculty and staff to easily monitor and record the attendance of their students every class.
