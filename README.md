# BSU Mobile Attendance Tool

Produces QR code per class that will be a requirement for the students to scan in order to verify their class attendance. It also creates a monthly report of your attendance in each class. This makes it easier for the students and as well as the facilitator of the class instead of having roll calls each class. They could just scan the QR code before or after the class.
